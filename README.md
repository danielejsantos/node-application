# Creating account server

All the instructions, architecture and decisions about the project can be found below.

## Language and Framework

Following the challenge recommendation to use my favorite language, the chosen one was JavaScript and Express.js, a Node framework.

## Settings

You must have Git installed in your machine to download the following GitHub repository:

- https://github.com/danielejsantos/node-application

Or you can download it by following the command:

`git clone https://github.com/danielejsantos/node-application.git`

Then, you must install its dependencies. At the root, run the command:

```
# with yarn:
yarn install
# with npm:
npm install
```

## How to run

Navigate to the root folder and run the following command:

```
# with yarn:
yarn start

```
